The concept behind LoanMitra is to create a comprehensive, AI-powered platform that addresses key challenges in the credit lending ecosystem, especially for underbanked and low-income borrowers. The platform aims to bridge the gap between financial institutions and beneficiaries by not only assessing creditworthiness accurately but also providing actionable insights for improving financial behavior and ensuring fair access to credit.
Key Issues Addressed
Limited Credit Visibility: Many underbanked individuals lack formal credit history, making it difficult for NBFCs and lenders to evaluate their creditworthiness accurately.
Data Gaps in Socio-Economic Behavior: Traditional lending relies on repayment history or basic financial data, which fails to capture holistic socio-economic behavior, consumption patterns, and alternative indicators of creditworthiness.
Delayed Lending Decisions: Manual verification and risk assessment processes increase turnaround time, limiting the scalability of digital lending for low-income groups.
Market Need
Existing lending solutions often fail to integrate alternative data and AI-driven insights, leaving a significant segment of the population underserved. There is a clear need for a platform that can dynamically assess risk, recommend lending actions, and enable faster, fairer, and transparent access to credit for underbanked populations.
LoanMitra’s Solution
LoanMitra presents a multi-layered solution combining AI/ML-based credit scoring, socio-economic data analysis, and explainable decision-making into a single platform.
Key Features:
Data Acquisition & Onboarding: Collects repayment history, income proofs, and consumption data (energy, UPI, mobile, and utilities) via APIs and user uploads. Identity is verified through PAN/Aadhaar APIs.
Feature Engineering & Processing: Cleans, normalizes, and imputes multi-source data; derives behavioral and financial indicators such as repayment-to-income ratio, energy per capita, and transaction patterns.
AI/ML Credit Scoring: Logistic Regression model calculates a Composite Beneficiary Credit Score (CBCS) (0–1000) by combining repayment behavior, financial metrics, and consumption data. Dynamic retraining ensures adaptive scoring as new data arrives.
Explainability & Transparency: SHAP-based explainability highlights both global and local feature contributions, ensuring audit-ready transparency and trust.
Decision Intelligence & Digital Lending: Low-risk beneficiaries receive instant approvals, while medium/high-risk cases undergo AI/manual review. Real-time feedback and re-scoring improve turnaround for repeat borrowers.
Visualization & Monitoring: Dashboards provide admin insights (risk segmentation, SHAP visualizations) and user insights (score transparency, eligibility status, document uploads).
